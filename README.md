# question-answering-tweetqa-using-bert
Question answering is a critical NLP problem,  3 which is concerned with building systems that  4 automatically answer questions posed by humans  5 in a natural language. It has applications in many  6 fields where a language model is trained on a large  7 collection of articles/paragraphs and the model is  8 able to answer questions pertaining to the  9 paragraph accurately. Social media is now  10 becoming an important real-time information  11 source, especially during natural disasters and  12 emergencies. It is now very common for traditional  13 news media to frequently probe users and resort to  14 social media platforms to obtain real-time  15 developments of events. Previous datasets have  16 concentrated on question answering (QA) for  17 formal text like news and Wikipedia. In this project  18 we will use TweetQA (Xiong et al.,2019), the first  19 large-scale dataset for QA over social media data to  20 compare different models of BERT.
