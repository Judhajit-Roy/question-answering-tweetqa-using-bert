# Problem Description

## Exploring Question Answering (QA) on Tweets using BERT and its variants
Social Media platforms have become an integral
part of peopleâ€™s life over the last few years. They
act as a provider of varied information, a subpart
being the source of news and various real-time
events that are happening around the globe. In this
paper, we aim to explore Question Answering in
a more informal space like twitter. Almost all of
the previous research focused on the Question
Answering task is done on datasets containing
formally or academically written literature. The
issue of unavailability of social media data for
training models for question answering is
addressed by using the TweetQA dataset. We
study techniques like Data Augmentation to
improve standard BERT models and observe how
hyperparameter tuning effects the performance of
the different models. The performance of models
finetuned on SQuAD was compared with the
vanilla models. We use the Exact Match and F1
score metrics and our results point to the need of
improved QA systems targeting social media text.
