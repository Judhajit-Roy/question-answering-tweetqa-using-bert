# Problem Description
Question answering is a critical NLP problem, which is concerned with building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language. It has applications in many fields where a language model is trained on a large collection of articles/paragraphs and the model is able to answer questions pertaining to the  paragraph accurately. Social media is now becoming an important real-time information source, especially during natural disasters and emergencies. It is now very common for traditional news media to frequently probe users and resort to social media platforms to obtain real-time developments of events. Previous datasets have concentrated on question answering (QA) for formal text like news and Wikipedia. In this project we will use TweetQA (Xiong et al.,2019), the first large-scale dataset for QA over social media data to compare different models of BERT.
